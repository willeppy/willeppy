Hi my name is Will and I'm a PhD student at CMU in the HCII. I work on intelligent data science tools. Some of the stuff I'm working on is here and the rest is over at the [CMU DIG](https://github.com/cmudig) github page.

My most recent research papers are on my website [willepperson.com](https://willepperson.com).

I also like to climb 🧗🏼‍♂️ and ski ⛷.

If you like what I'm working on or have ideas to collab please email me :)
