Hi my name is Will and I'm a software engineer working on AI agents at Microsoft. I did my PhD at CMU in HCII working on interactive data profiling tools for developers. 

My most recent research papers are on my website [willepperson.com](https://willepperson.com).

I also like to climb 🧗🏼‍♂️ and ski ⛷.

If you like what I'm working on or have ideas to collab please email me :)
